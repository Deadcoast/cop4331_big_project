# Brownie Points Recipe Web App

## Synopsis

This repo contains the code created for the COP4331 Processes of Object Oriented Software Fall 2021 project. Brownie Points implementes a MERN stack and exports image storage/processing to AWS S3.

There are many hindsight considerations that were discovered with this project. It is important to note that all the developers entered this project with no prior knowledge of JavaScript, Web Development, Express, React, or npm and constructed this application within 6 weeks while simultaneously being enrolled full-time at the University of Central Florida.

## Known Issues

Currently, there is a known issue with AWS S3 periodically rejecting requests to store images in the bucket. The research conducted on this issue does not point to a specific source. However, since the project is past it's lifespan, the issue is no longer being looked into.

## Mobile Version

There is a [mobile version](https://github.com/Deadcoast/cop4331_big_project_mobile) of Brownie Points currently available on Android.
